ImageSnippets lets you create a responsive image gallery.

== Description ==

ImageSnippets lets you create a responsive image gallery using ImageSnippets end point, username, property and object.

Major features in ImageSnippets allows you to:

* Add/remove/edit multiple galleries.
* Regenerate your gallery manually or schedule an automated task.

We are using REST API (https://www.setcronjob.com/) that will allow you to create a cron job service for regenerating your gallery. To do so, you have to create an account and generate API token. 

* Signup for free at <a href="https://www.setcronjob.com/" target="_blank">setcronjob.com</a>.
* Generate your API key by navigating to Account > API Key.
* Copy your API KEY in ImageSnippets Gallery > Cron Settings page.

== Installation ==

The plugin is simple to install:
* Install the REQUIRED plugin, "wp-autop"
* Upload the plugin files to the 'wp-content/plugins/image-snippet' directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
* Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
* Use the Image Snippet->Settings to generate your gallery
